#The story starts.

The unknown person was approaching my {fav_person}.
Suddenly I felt uncomfortable even though nothing was {current_feelings}.
The person was holding a {adjective_1} {fav_food}.
My {fav_person} without a single {noun}, told me to {verb} as fast as I could.
I instinctively reacted with a big {facial_expression}.
The person was my {parent}! {parent} surprised us with {adjective_1} {fav_food} ðŸ˜Š.
{fav_person} just tried to eat that whole {fav_food} without me -_-!
